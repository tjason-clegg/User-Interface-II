        <h2 class="introHead">Welcome To My Website!</h2>
        <p>This site is for me to be able to show my capabalities as a WebDev, as well as show you some of the projects that I have made/worked on in Lambda! While it may not be much for now, I plan on growing and making this into a more detailed site the more I learn and progress through the course.</p>
        <p>A little bit about myself, I grew up in American Fork, Utah and went to American Fork High School. When I was in highschool, I started to get very interested in different types of sciences. I started to look at all the science courses my highschool offered and noticed there was nothing about Computer Science, so I asked my councilor about it. She told me that they had enough technology classes a coding classes that they didn't feel like they needed to offer it. Long story short I asked her what coding classes they had and she mentioned Java. I decided to sign up for it during the second semester, without realizing that they were already halfway through the course! I ended up only taking it for a week before giving up because they were so far ahead of me, I felt as though I couldn't catch up. To this day that is the only thing I have givin up on, and so I plan on coming back with a sweet vengeance!</p>
